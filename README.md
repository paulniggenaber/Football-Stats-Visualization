### Predicting-Football-Transfer-Fees

In this project I want to find out how the predictive power of individual player data is for the prediction of transfer fees. 
While it is shown that there is some predictive power, I also discuss the limitations given by the data and the inherent nature of the formation of transfer fees in professional football.
