# Football-Stats-Visualization
Scraped Data from the Top 5 leagues in European football is used to give interesting insights into individual player and team performances in the timeframe from 2018 - 2025.

This project was done in the context of the first semster course Big Data Curation in my Master in Data Science for Business. It is the first of two parts, where the second part is concerned about prediciting transfer fees based on individual player data. The assignment can be found in BDassignment1.pdf.
